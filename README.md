# SROIEChallenge

Contains 101 annotations of SROIE samples from the train split, which aim to provide challenging questions that require layout understanding on a deeper level than the original SROIE.
The questions are organized into three categories: quantity, currency and string.
The data is to be used with the [revised SROIE dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/urbikn/sroie-datasetv2).
